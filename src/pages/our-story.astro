                    Bastiaan grew up in Indonesia where he was exposed to the furniture industry at a young age. Thirty years prior his parents, Leuntje and Douwe, started a
                    furniture company in Java. From the start the company has been producing furniture on a large scale for renowned European brands.
                  </p>
                  <p class="pl-6 lg:pl-0 lg:w-1/2">
                    At the age of thirty, Bastiaan revisited Indonesia to try and raise his parents’ company to a higher level. The core business of his parents was to make
                    customized products for European brands. Bastiaan saw an opportunity to design an entire collection himself and offer it to international customers. He offered
                    his own designs to contemporary wholesale brands and before he knew it his white label collection was being sold on a large scale all over the world. ByE was
                    now selling its collection straight from the factory to all over the world; from Australia, Asia, the US, Europe, the Middle East to Latin America.

                  The following year ByE participated at the largest European furniture fair in Paris, Maison & Objet, where it received a prize for the best designed chair the
                  first time it participated. At the Jakarta fair ByE received prizes for the best stand. The newcomer was receiving recognition from both the customers ordering
                  all over the world and the industry itself giving out prizes for the designs. Bastiaan finds it essential that the ByE collection is contemporary, complete and
                  innovative, combining Indonesian craftsmanship with Western design influences. In addition, the collection can be easily combined with different interior styles.

                    Firstly, Bastiaan designs the products he wants to see in the collection. He keeps in mind that the products need to be compatible with different styles, but
                    still distinctive enough to give it personality, albeit neutral and timeless. After the development phase the collection will be produced in the Elements
                    Factory.

                  <p class="pl-6">
                    Bastiaan exposes his annual new collection at international furniture fairs where buyers can order his products by the container. As soon as the order has been
                    placed the products will be made in the factory. A sea freight container will be filled with the products and will be shipped to the customer’s destination. As
                    soon as the ship as at sea, the container with the products will become the property of the customer.
