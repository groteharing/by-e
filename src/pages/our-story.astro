                    Bastiaan grew up in Indonesia where he was exposed to the
                    furniture industry at a young age. Thirty years prior his
                    parents, Leuntje and Douwe, started a furniture company in
                    Java. From the start the company has been producing
                    furniture on a large scale for renowned European brands.
                  </p>
                  <p class="pl-6">
                    At the age of thirty, Bastiaan revisited Indonesia to try
                    and raise his parents’ company to a higher level. The core
                    business of his parents was to make customized products for
                    European brands. Bastiaan saw an opportunity to design an
                    entire collection himself and offer it to international
                    customers. He offered his own designs to contemporary
                    wholesale brands and before he knew it his white label
                    collection was being sold on a large scale all over the
                    world. ByE was now selling its collection straight from the
                    factory to all over the world; from Australia, Asia, the US,
                    Europe, the Middle East to Latin America.

                <p>
                  The following year ByE participated at the largest European
                  furniture fair in Paris, Maison & Objet, where it received a
                  prize for the best designed chair the first time it
                  participated. At the Jakarta fair ByE received prizes for the
                  best stand. The newcomer was receiving recognition from both
                  the customers ordering all over the world and the industry
                  itself giving out prizes for the designs. Bastiaan finds it
                  essential that the ByE collection is contemporary, complete
                  and innovative, combining Indonesian craftsmanship with
                  Western design influences. In addition, the collection can be
                  easily combined with different interior styles.

                    Firstly, Bastiaan designs the products he wants to see in
                    the collection. He keeps in mind that the products need to
                    be compatible with different styles, but still distinctive
                    enough to give it personality, albeit neutral and timeless.
                    After the development phase the collection will be produced
                    in the Elements Factory.
                  </p>
                  <p class="pl-6">
                    Bastiaan exposes his annual new collection at international
                    furniture fairs where buyers can order his products by the
                    container. As soon as the order has been placed the products
                    will be made in the factory. A sea freight container will be
                    filled with the products and will be shipped to the
                    customer’s destination. As soon as the ship as at sea, the
                    container with the products will become the property of the
                    customer.
